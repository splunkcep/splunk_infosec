## About Boss of the SOC (BOTS) Dataset Version 3

A sample security dataset and CTF platform for information security professionals, researchers, students, and enthusiasts.

### About BOTS v3 Prerequisite Apps

The dataset requires the following apps which are distributed and licensed separately and **should be installed before using the dataset**. We are using different app versions from the originally intended use of the dataset and some things may not work properly, but it will work fine for lab purposes. More information about BOTS v3 can be found [here](https://github.com/splunk/botsv3).

## Installing the Splunk InfoSec App & BOTS v3 Dataset

### Prerequisites

Ensure Splunk Enterprise is installed and running. Verify the installation status:

```
su splunkuser
```
```
/opt/splunk/bin/splunk status
```

If Splunk is not running, start it using:

```
/opt/splunk/bin/splunk start
```

### Step-by-Step Installation
   - [Install via Splunk Web](#method-1-install-via-splunk-web)
   - [Install via CLI](#method-2-install-via-command-line)
> Jump to this [step](#4-extract-files) if you are using the TD SYNNEX environment for this lab 

#### Method 1: Install via Splunk Web

Even though it is possible to install the Apps via Splunk Web, it is still necessary to unzip/untar the BOTS dataset using the command line interface.
Here are the steps to install the apps and then uncompress the dataset.

##### 1. **Access Splunkbase:**
   - Visit [Splunkbase](https://splunkbase.splunk.com).
   - Search for "Splunk InfoSec App" and download it along with all prerequisite apps.

##### 2. **Upload the App to Splunk:**
   - Log in to your Splunk Web interface.
   - Navigate to **Apps** > **Manage Apps**.
   - Click on **Install app from file**.
   - Select the downloaded app package and click **Upload**.

##### 3. **Verify Installation:**
   - Ensure the apps are listed under **Apps**.

##### 4. **BOTS v3 Installation:**
   Download the BOTS v3 dataset:
     ```bash
     wget https://botsdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/botsv3/botsv3_data_set.tgz
     ```
##### 5. **Extract Files:**
   Unzip/untar the downloaded file into `$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps`:
     ```bash
     sudo tar -xvf botsv3_data_set.tgz -C /opt/splunk/etc/apps/
     ```
##### 6. **Assign Ownership:**
   Ensure the correct user has ownership of the directories and files used by Splunk:
     ```bash
     sudo chown -R splunkuser:splunkuser /opt/splunk
     ```
##### 7. **Start Splunk:**
   ```bash
   /opt/splunk/bin/splunk start
   ```

#### Method 2: Install via Command Line

##### 1. **Stop Splunk:**
   ```bash
   /opt/splunk/bin/splunk stop
   ```

##### 2. **Download and Extract Apps:**
   Create a downloads directory:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /opt/downloads
   ```
   ```bash
   cd /opt/downloads/
   ```
   Clone the repository or download manually:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/artioli/splunk.git
   ```
   ```bash
   cd /opt/downloads/botsv3_&_infosec_apps/
   ```

##### 3. **Download BOTS v3 Dataset:**
   ```bash
   wget https://botsdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/botsv3/botsv3_data_set.tgz
   ```

##### 4. **Extract Files:**
   ```bash
   for file in *.tgz; do
       tar -xf "$file" -C /opt/splunk/etc/apps/
   done
   ```

##### 5. **Assign Ownership:**
   ```bash
   sudo chown -R splunkuser:splunkuser /opt/splunk
   ```

##### 6. **Start Splunk:**
   ```bash
   /opt/splunk/bin/splunk start
   ```

#### Using the dataset and configuring InfoSeec

##### 1. **Verify Data Import:**
   Open Splunk Web and search for the dataset using:
     ```
     index=botsv3 earliest=0
     ```
   - Ensure the data is accessible.
   - > **Note** that this dataset does not count against Splunk's licensing limits due to its pre-indexed nature.

##### 2. **Configuring InfoSec:**

   - All data used by InfoSec app must be Common Information Model (CIM)-compliant. 
   - The following Data Models must be accelerated:
      - Authentication
      - Change
      - Intrusion_Detection
      - Malware
      - Network_Sessions
      - Network_Traffic
      - Endpoint
      - Web

   - Steps
      - On your Splunk platform deployment, in Splunk Web, go to **Settings > Data Models**.
      - Select **Edit > Edit Acceleration** for an accelerated data model that you want to edit.
      - Select **Summary Range > All Time** and click **Save**.
      - > **Note** When accelerating data models to *All Time*, ensure this is only done in a controlled lab environment. In production, consider the impact on performance and storage.

   - The acceleration may take a while.
   - After the acceleration is done, access the InfoSec App and filter the events using the time range "All Time"

   - Refer to the [SplunkÂ® InfoSec App Docs](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/InfoSec) for detailed instructions.
